Welcome to the Cannon Beach Background Updater!

This app grabs the latest image from the Tolvana Inn webcam at Cannon Beach, OR and sets it to the background every five minutes.

Simply run the Cannon Beach Installer app and all the necessary scripts will be installed where they need to go.
Note that this app does not actually live in the Applications folder, but is simply a Script and LaunchAgent in the user's Library.

To uninstall, simply run the Uninstaller in the .dmg you downloaded to originally install this app.
