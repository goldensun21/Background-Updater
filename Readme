Installation Instructions:

Once .zip is opened/expanded, move the app "Background Updater to your Applications folder and open it.
macOS will alert you that the app cannot be open as it is from an unidentified developer. Click "OK."
Open System Preferences and navigate to Security and Privacy. Go to the General tab.
Click "Open Anyway" in this menu. This will open a pop-up where you can again select "Open."

After the above is complete, double click the app "Updater Scheduler" and follow the above instructions regarding Security and Privacy in System Preferences.
Note that the Updater Scheduler app does not need to be moved to the Applications folder as it only installs a scheduler script in ~/Library/LaunchAgents

Once the above steps are complete, the Cannon Beach Background Updater will be installed to update your desktop background every five minutes.
